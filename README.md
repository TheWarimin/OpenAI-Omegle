# OpenAI-Omegle
is a bot for educational purposes
this script has many bugs

1- first you have to set the path to chromedriver.exe
2- second you have to set the topic
(if you don't put anything it's default)
3- third you have to put api keys (the key is in "https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys" where you have to login)
4- with that it should work, but as I said before it has many bugs and it was done in one night because I had insomnia, do not judge me.
